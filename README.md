# HMMandPPMcode

Two R scripts are included with sample GPS data to run Hidden Markov and Point Process models. HMM is to be run first on cleaned GPS data with appropriate covariates added. 

Then, once the best HMM is chosen it should be saved and uploaded into the PPM script. Our example uses the PPM foraging behaviour script, which uses all non-foraging GPS points as background effort.
Functions are used in the PPM script and provided.
